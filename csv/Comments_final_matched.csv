10,11,2,I'm taking this teacher's 5001 course in Fall 2022. and I just finished the midterm. which wasn't too hard. I'm not sure what the final will be like. But so far. the teacher's instruction is mediocre. and the classes involve a lot of time-wasting. Students with a background in the subject should find his class an easy A. However. if you lack the background and really want to learn. you won't get much out of this teacher's course.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.485
3,50,4,Very patient. quick to respond to emails. generous with grading. and offers opportunities for bonus tasks. Midterm exams and a final project. Slides are concise. Like many CS courses. it still requires some self-study.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.486
3,5,5,The workload is somewhat heavy. and the object-oriented assignments mainly involve repetitive coding. designing classes to fulfill various function requirements. which is rather dull but still time-consuming. The exams also have a significant number of questions. During the era I attended. we still had to go to the classroom for exams. requiring handwritten Java classes. It was nearly impossible to finish without getting hand cramps. but Abi was generally considerate towards students. likely offering opportunities for retakes.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.487
3,5,5,American teacher. with a pure accent.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.488
3,5,3,Average. the lecture is not clear. it's like you're self-studying throughout the course.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.489
48,56,1,Lacks a strong foundation in computing. many question his coding ability. The class is entirely group discussion. almost zero teaching. and he has a perfect excuse to avoid exposing his teaching ability: 'you guys are master students. you need to learn by yourself'. The DB course completely utilized the resources. videos. and homework of a teacher from Seattle. One of the least competent teachers at the Vancouver campus.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.490
48,56,1,One homework and one lab every week. all coding. After week ten. there's a final project. no more HW and lab. Midterms and final exams are closed book. but grades will be curved up. There's a group presentation in the second to last week of the final term.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.491
5,7,1,There were comments before that the grading isn't high. but the teaching is serious. really? The Fall 2022 lecture experience was extremely bad. the workload was huge. the TA was not bad. but this professor graded very poorly. a bunch of us sent emails to the college to complain and argue about grades.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.492
18,11,2,The teacher always gets the example problems wrong in class. not a single class goes by without mistakes. and even when students point them out she struggles to respond on the spot. sometimes needing us to go to the blackboard to help her write the solutions. It feels like paying tuition to teach the teacher. Homework and exams both require showing work steps. She said no calculators were needed for the exams because the final answers didn't have to be calculated. but then there's no standard for the steps. after the exam we heard that writing out 21^7 as seven 21s multiplied together was considered fully showing the steps...,2024-04-22T10:37:30.493
18,11,4,The homework answers are easy to find. and the workload is light. with one assignment every 2-3 weeks. consisting of 4-5 questions. The grading is good. An A- is quite manageable. while an A requires above 95%. Additional The course is extremely easy. and the teacher is considerate. The teacher's classes are very relaxed; each session starts with half an hour of distributing pizza to everyone. followed by a casual lecture for just over an hour. after which he usually ends the class early. It's really an easy course. All you need to do is sign in for each class (missing a few doesnt really matter; in the end. full attendance is given to the entire class). Homework is assigned every three weeks. usually about four questions. which can be directly found on Google as they are often the same problems used at other schools. allowing for direct copying. Normally. it feels like there's hardly any need to attend this course. Just pay a little attention to reviewing before midterms and finals. studying a few days is generally enough. Scoring 90 is easy. but getting above 94 is somewhat challenging.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.494
55,76,1,null,2024-04-22T10:37:30.495
55,76,5,The person is very nice. and the homework is relatively simple.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.496
23,21,1,You must absolutely avoid this course! The workload in Tony's class is enormous (equivalent to 1-1.5 times that of MSCS 5010). It is highly discouraged during job search season! Although the average grade of B+ is acceptable. there are many easier courses available. Why choose one with such a heavy workload and only average grading. which could be stressful and reduce your time for job searching?,2024-04-22T10:37:30.497
23,21,1,Avoid all of Tonys classes. It has been said that due to the leniency of his previous courses. they came under scrutiny by the school. and as a result. the workload in all of Tonys current classes has significantly increased (now requiring at least 2-3 days each week to complete homework). Please avoid these classes during the job-searching season in the fall (spring enrollment is fine). If you have expertise in cloud computing and can easily handle the assignments. feel free to disregard these comments. The final exam had an average score of 45%. which could drastically pull your grade down from an A to nearly a C. The homework consists of challenging algorithmic proofs. and it's stressful to write them weekly.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.498
27,22,3,The professor barely discusses code during lectures. but the TA dream team carries the whole course. There are fewer labs compared to Tamara's next door. Assignments are often postponed. providing about a week and a half to complete them. The lectures are disastrous. even harder to understand than Tamaras. Initially. I thought that since the teacher was from India and held a PhD. I would definitely learn something. but it turned out to be entirely self-taught. I do not recommend this course.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.499
27,22,4,Easy course with a light workload.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.500
27,22,4,Although the teacher has an accent. he is very nice.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.501
27,22,5,There is one major assignment each week involving a lot of writing. The homework questions are devised by the teacher based on the course content and are somewhat challenging. However. during lab sessions. the teacher addresses each question thoroughly. so completing assignments is manageable. There are no in-class exams; both midterms and finals are take-home exams. which are quite simple. TAs grade generously. and overall grading is high. The weekly major assignments are numerous and time-consuming. Particularly because the teacher requires that every step of the answers be written out in great detail. with no steps skipped. Typically. solving five math problems per assignment involves writing several thousand words. There is a direct correlation between the amount of text written and the grades. which can be exhausting. Grading is quite high. and achieving an A is relatively easy if you are willing to write extensively. Overall. I would recommend this course.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.502
43,47,4,The workload is light. and the grading is good. I attended during his first semester teaching here. He previously seemed to be a Python engineer and is not very familiar with Java. so his teaching is average. However. he is very conscientious. responsible. and both friendly and modest.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.503
43,47,1,Language: C. There are only four assignments. but each one is more difficult than the last. requiring significant time investment to write and challenging to debug. Without a solid background in C. it can be overwhelming; it essentially relies on self-study. There are no exams or projects. just these four assignments to determine your grade. and it's hard to say whether this is good or bad. Additional: The assignment frameworks seem to be created by the teacher. possibly inspired by homework from other universities. but this actually reduces the workload and difficulty. So. it's not a complete operating system. but rather the implementation of some simulated functions. There might be some imperfections in the assignments. but posting questions on Piazza usually receives a prompt response from the teacher. Since there are only four assignments. if you can dedicate three to four days to studying them. they are manageable. The main requirement of this course is to install a virtual machine to test the assignments. The teacher is quite enthusiastic. but if you already have a background in operating systems or wish to develop a complete operating system. this course might not meet your expectations. However. if you want an introduction to various operating system concepts. this course can achieve that. There should be some previous class slides and materials available online.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.504
43,47,2,null,2024-04-22T10:37:30.505
28,29,3,The homework involves completing exercises from two to three chapters of a book each week. and you also need to have a weekly one-on-one meeting with the TA. during which a few questions will be selected for you to explain your approach (so you need to do the assignments yourself). The exams consist of two mastery sessions. where the TA asks you questions on Teams in an open-book format. lasting about twenty minutes. There are two projects at the end of the term. one on File Systems and one group project. Overall. the workload is substantial and more demanding than other courses.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.506
28,29,2,The homework consists of a weekly quiz. plus a total of three assignments (React Native projects).,2024-04-22T10:37:30.507
26,26,5,There is very little homework. If it takes more than an hour to complete. you may need to review the concepts you've missed.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.508
26,26,5,There is one assignment each week. The first time. it took me about 10 hours. but eight of those hours were spent learning how to type. After I started using Overleaf. it became much quicker. People who directly tackle LaTeX are truly commendable. Subsequently. the assignments took me between 1 to 3 hours to complete. I also formed a study group to discuss the homework answers. spending about half an hour each week on this. I think the grading is quite generous. as there are bonus points available for each homework and exam. The main thing during exams is to manage your time well. not to spend too long on any one question. and to make sure to review your answers after completing them all once.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.509
25,37,3,The grading for the homework is rather unpredictable. sometimes high and sometimes low. There are no exams. Students with a background in NLP can generally achieve higher scores on the assignments. This is the only advantage of the course. If you have a strong foundation in NLP and are looking to boost your grades. this course might be a good option. provided you dont mind not learning much new material.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.510
25,37,4,His grading is mainly divided into two parts. Part 1: Lucky Wheel & Tweet; Part 2: Four projects. Part 1 involves a lucky wheel that he created. which features each student's name. During class. he spins the wheel and asks a question to the student it lands on. If answered correctly. the student receives 1-2 points; if incorrect. they receive 0 points. If the student is absent. they lose 1 point. For the tweet. students must post weekly content related to the reading materials. The TA grades these tweets on how interesting they are. with scores ranging from 0 to 2 points; not posting results in a loss of 1 point. This part accounts for 40% of the total grade. The grading mechanism is unique: if a student's score is above the class average. they receive 100%; if below. they get 33%. with no intermediate values. Part 2 consists of four projects: the first is a front-end self-introduction. the second involves a back-end on any topic. the third is full-stack. and the fourth is an improved version of the third. with specific requirements like accessibility.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.511
32,36,3,The workload isn't heavy. totaling 2-3 projects. The final exam is another web project similar to the previous ones. and many codes can be reused. making it quite easy. The grading is very generous. ~ The homework load has increased. now with 4 projects. but they progress gradually. allowing you to apply new technologies step by step. The workload is quite substantial with 4 full-stack projects. but they are very helpful for mastering the topics. requiring a lot of time and effort. Each project includes recording an introduction video. making a PowerPoint presentation. and for the final. writing a report and recording an interview video. which feels like a lot of unnecessary work. This teacher spends most of the time either on the lucky wheel or assigning homework. not suitable for beginners. He generally assumes you understand the content. The workload mainly involves self-study. There are many projects. and the teaching feels rushed because half of the time is spent on the wheel. Overall. the course is okay. skewed towards front-end. especially suitable for those who are already skilled in front-end to easily get a full score. You can view previous students' homework and course content here. Although the teacher was quite stern at the beginning. most students ended up with full marks. The homework has rubrics. regular scores come from random classroom question sessions (lucky wheel) and pre-class reading tweets. and project grades from 4 projects. Not all are full-stack; the first is a static personal homepage using HTML. CSS. JS without frameworks deployed to GitHub. the second mixes frontend and backend using Express (database MongoDB). the third is a full-stack with React (with hooks) frontend and Express backend (database MongoDB) deployed to Heroku. and the fourth improves on the third. focusing on layout. accessibility. etc. The backend must use Node.js. Students have asked if they could use Spring Boot. but its not allowed. The database cannot be switched to MySQL. MongoDB must not use convenient libraries like Mongoose. only the official library. Essentially. you use what the teacher specifies. Whether it's project or regular grades. if points are deducted. you can undertake additional requirements or videos for extra credit. You can also proactively approach the teacher during office hours to discuss additional tasks for extra points. High scores are achievable if you aim for them. For instance. if you lose points on project 2. you can compensate in project 3 by incorporating websockets or adding image upload functionality for extra points. potentially raising a 100-point assignment to 120 points. specifics to be discussed with the teacher. If you already know front-end JS and related technologies. the workload will likely feel manageable. even easy. The load comes from rushing self-study. taking on too many extra credit tasks. and perfectionism in tweaking CSS. among other things.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.512
6,8,2,Homework and exams all follow Adrienne's lead. with grading mostly done by TAs. (Supplementary about Adrienne: It's advised to self-study some C beforehand. The homework is unreasonably difficult. It's impossible to build a foundation through this course alone; you'll be lost right away. It's also recommended to look at algorithms on your own; and to study computer systems by yourself. During lectures. it's easy to lose focus. While the grades given are good. the feeling of not learning anything and not being able to complete the homework might be more intense. Of course. the best choice would be to learn from other teachers.),2024-04-22T10:37:30.513
35,37,4,The lecture quality is average. but since the content is not difficult. it's still manageable to learn. The teacher has a very positive attitude and encourages students to ask questions. Quizzes can be resubmitted an unlimited number of times before the deadline (there are special requirements. but generally. you can get full marks through resubmission). Each assignment has a deadline. but they are not considered late if submitted before three major deadlines. so it's quite easy to score. There are no exams. but there is a task where you're required to write a textbook. It depends on whether you feel comfortable with the task of writing a textbook. It's relatively easy to score well.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.514
34,36,1,Assignments: There are 6 assignments. each with unclear requirements. If you do not ask for clarification. points will be deducted. Grading is strict. and the instructor personally reviews each assignment. TAs are unclear about grading criteria until they receive the instructions. Typically. the relevant knowledge for the assignments is only discussed on the day they are due. Projects: There are 3 projects. with two needing to be completed in the last three weeks. The requirements for these are clear. and the main challenge lies in selecting a topic. Unless you employ some new technologies. the projects may not be impressive enough to add to your resume.Exams: There are none.Classroom: It's like a roulette wheel with random questions asked. You get 2 points for answering correctly. 1 point for a partially correct answer. and 0 points for not answering. If you are absent from the class. you lose 1 point. Leave of absence is not permitted. The instructor is very enthusiastic about this system and may become upset if it's discovered that you are not paying attention in class.Languages: SQL. MongoDB. JS. Node. CSS. HTML. Express. Redis. Ajax.Quizzes: There is one every week. They do not count towards your grade. so you can fill them out casually.Comment on the teacher: The teacher is deemed to be not very effective and the course is considered to be exceptionally challenging.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.515
34,36,4,If you diligently complete the regular assignments. you can achieve a full 40% of your grade. The difficulty level of the midterm and final is similar to that of the homework. Additionally. before each class. there are zyBooks reading and practice assignments which account for 10% of the total grade. Attendance makes up 5% of the overall grade.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.516
40,39,2,John is a genuinely nice person. He is located in Toronto but teaches at the Vancouver campus. There are no lectures. but there are three open mic Q&A sessions each week. each lasting an hour. during which you can work on that week's lab. If the homework is difficult. he will also discuss approaches. Every week. you are expected to self-study by watching align online videos provided by the school. and then complete quizzes. coding practices (not graded). and labs. There are 7 homework assignments throughout the term. and they are graded very fairly. If there are minor issues. only a few points will be deducted as a reminder. and the reasons for the deductions will be clearly explained. Piazza and email responses are prompt. and the teacher encourages students to contact him directly on Teams with any issues. The midterm consists of half multiple-choice questions and half coding problems (which you have one week to complete). and the difficulty is moderate. not meant to be overly challenging. Overall. I highly recommend this course.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.517
41,38,5,Each week there is one quiz and one lab. with homework assigned on average every 1-2 weeks. The teacher is very responsible and willing to invest time. There are many time slots for office hours. Responses on Piazza are very quick and detailed. Grading is quite generous. There is a strong emphasis on cultivating students' coding thinking and good habits.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.518
4,6,4,Grades are determined by three assignments. with one assignment due every four weeks. The workload is light. and the grading is also good. It's an easy course.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.519
56,77,3,There is a substantial amount of reading material to preview each week. accompanied by some summary/supplementary videos. In class. Jack briefly goes over the content of the week. but it's not very helpful. Essentially. learning and understanding depend on the individual.Homework: There is one quiz and one assignment each week. For beginners. it's a matter of several hours' worth of work.Exams: There is one midterm project and one final project. both of which are completed in groups. Additionally. there is one exam to be completed in class.Overall. the grading is very generous. Jack is a nice guy. and since he is always on campus. he is easy to find. How much you learn depends on the individual.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.520
30,32,3,Homework: There are 5 projects plus a Final Project. ,2024-04-22T10:37:30.521
30,32,4,Seeking an evaluation. Recommended. This is a teacher from whom you can learn a lot. and the grading is fair. The amount of homework is moderate. If you pay attention in class and do a bit of research afterward. you'll be able to do the homework. The teacher is very fair and doesn't cut corners. The teaching quality is good. Attendance is taken during class. The Python projects done can be listed on your resume. It seems that the teacher came from Boston.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.522
44,49,1,"The PDP/OOD course instructor will challenge you intensely during Code Walks. If you say something incorrect, she may deduct half of your points immediately. If you try to argue with her, she can become more aggressive; then when you concede and say she's right and that you have learned your lesson, she might still deduct half of your points because you didn't withstand the challenge. Additional information: I've taken her online 5001 course. Perhaps because it's online and there's no face-to-face interaction, it felt okay. The workload is a bit heavier compared to other campuses. There's a weekly quiz, coding practice (which isn't graded), lab, and homework. Assignments are uploaded to Codepost for automatic grading followed by a TA review. The grading seems quite high (it seems now on Codepost you can't immediately see the test scores anymore??). There are two exams, midterm and final, which require using a browser lockdown system to write offline and are timed. They make up a significant portion of the grade and she personally grades them. The class average was in the 80s for the midterm and in the 70s for the final. In her class, the number of students getting an A or A- can be counted on one hand. Additional comment: Jump is just plain silly. Self-evaluation is like working for them. They give the lowest possible marks. The workload for 5010 is equivalent to about 5-6 other classes (no exaggeration). There are a ton of time-consuming and seemingly pointless assignments. If you deviate even slightly from her specific requirements, she deducts a lot of points. Supplement 2: If you want to torture yourself, take this class. You'll regret it to the point of depression. Supplement 3: I'm in despair because I didn't read the evaluations before enrolling. Supplement 4: Don't be misled by those who say this course is an easy A. Supplement 5: Why wasn't there a guide like this when I enrolled! Don't make the same mistake I did. She can't clarify questions on Piazza well and can make incorrect things sound correct. She often speaks in half-sentences and uses '...' making you guess her intentions. Many tests on Codepost are wrong. I've always had straight As, but after the final exam, I was dropped to an A-. Moreover, you can't see the feedback and there's no opportunity to argue. Really, don't take this course!!! Final note: You indeed can learn a lot, but be prepared for a massive workload that is very draining.",2024-04-22T10:37:30.523
21,18,4,"This course is very easy, to the point of being too easy. It's based on Java and Android Studio and is suitable for those who just want to pass without much effort, but not for those who want to learn in-depth. There's hardly any workload. The instructor has a strong Indian accent, comparable to the purity of 24K gold. This could be an interesting experience for those who appreciate or want to learn from an Indian accent. The grading structure is as follows: There are some very basic Android homework assignments akin to 'Hello World' level. There are no rubrics, so it's unclear under what circumstances points would be deducted, but in practice, points weren't taken off. All assignments were ultimately graded 1.0/1.0. It seems that there was never any intention to deduct points—just turning in the work was sufficient. There are open-book quizzes during class. The answers can be found in the PDFs provided on Canvas modules; you just need to use Ctrl+F to search the question stems. If you search diligently, you can score nearly perfect marks. You have to choose one paper from those provided by the teacher and do a presentation on it. As long as you make a good PowerPoint and show a good attitude, that should be sufficient. The teacher might ask a token question, and you give a token answer. It seems that TAs are involved in grading this part, and this is where most points were deducted, about 8.5/10. Possibly because I wasn't very serious—I only looked at the article and made the PowerPoint at the last minute on the day of the presentation. The final project (which doesn't have a specific topic and no rubrics, completed in groups of four with a defense) felt like I didn't learn much but still easily got a full grade point. Those I know who didn't get full points only lost some on their presentation attitude as graded by the TA or didn't search carefully on the quizzes.",2024-04-22T10:37:30.524
45,53,4,The general content of the course includes mathematical analysis and probability and statistics that one might have studied before. It incorporates a bit about programming-related concepts like time complexity. DFS (Depth-First Search). and BFS (Breadth-First Search). but these are covered only theoretically without any coding involved. The homework is on the easier side. mostly covering topics that were discussed in the videos with slight variations. The exams are similar to the homework. At the end. there's a grade curve. and the lowest homework score is dropped. (Students who have previously taken related mathematics courses might consider trying to apply for a waiver for this course.),2024-04-22T10:37:30.525
20,14,3,"Major Assignment (Project): Number of Projects: There are 3 major assignments or projects. Individual and Teamwork: The first project is to be completed individually, while the subsequent projects are done as teamwork. Submission Frequency: Projects are due approximately every two to four weeks. Nature of Projects: These are essentially comprehensive web development tasks. Mini Assignments: Total Number: There are a total of 7 mini assignments. Assignment Details: Each assignment includes a few (two or three) small problems or tasks to be completed. Quizzes: Total Number: There are 3 quizzes throughout the course. Quiz Format: They are online, open book/internet, and must be completed within a set time limit. Discussion: Posts: Each student is required to submit two ""posts"" during the term. These posts should be based on front-end related blogs, articles, or videos that the student has viewed. Content: Students must write two paragraphs of reflection or thoughts on the material they engaged with. Responses: Additionally, each student is expected to choose and reply to the posts of two other students each week. This structure allows for a mix of individual work, collaborative projects, continuous learning through mini assignments, assessment of understanding via quizzes, and engagement with current topics in the field through discussions. This blend of activities is designed to facilitate a comprehensive learning experience.",2024-04-22T10:37:30.526
25,25,4,"The course you're describing seems to have a straightforward and fair assessment method, with the key points being: Homework (HW): You are expected to write about topics that have been covered in class. As long as you complete the homework diligently and pay attention during lectures, there should be no issues. Exams and Quizzes: The assessments, including exams and quizzes, are described as not being particularly difficult, suggesting that they are reasonable and aligned with the course content. Individual Assignments: For personal assignments, the instructor provides starting code, which can be very helpful. However, you've noted that occasionally there may be errors in the provided starter code. This can sometimes cause delays and may require extra attention from students to debug and fix. It's beneficial for students to be aware that they need to review the starter code carefully and potentially anticipate the need to correct errors. This not only ensures that they don't lose time on their assignments but also provides an opportunity to practice debugging—a valuable skill in programming. If errors in the starter code are common and significantly disruptive, it might be worth providing this feedback to the instructor so they can make improvements for future classes.",2024-04-22T10:37:30.527

50,65,5,"Group discussions are a fundamental part of each class session. There is a lab and a homework assignment each week. The difficulty of the homework assignments increases significantly after homework 7. The assignments prior to homework 7 are of moderate difficulty, including two proof homework assignments that are quite straightforward. A challenging aspect of the course is that the assignments are interdependent; if you perform poorly on earlier assignments, it can negatively impact your ability to succeed in subsequent ones. To add more context, the video lecture materials are likely sourced from the Boston campus. The instructor is responsible for delivering lectures and labs and is described as conscientious and dedicated, truly caring about the students' learning and wanting them to grasp the material. There is a strong emphasis on group discussions, topic presentations, and live coding exercises. The workload is significant, but the grading is fair—neither too lenient nor too strict. This course comes highly recommended within the Vancouver campus. This is one of the few courses where you can fully handle all the homework just by watching the Canvas videos and attending the lectures. The teaching content is closely related to the homework, and the course structure is very sensible. It is particularly helpful for students who are changing majors in understanding data structures and basic algorithms.",2024-04-22T10:37:30.531
50,65,4,"The course includes a weekly problem set consisting of 5 questions that require detailed step-by-step solutions. There is also a weekly quiz with 5 questions where only the answers need to be provided. These quizzes are not conducted in-class; rather, students take them home to complete on their own time. Both the midterm and final exams are take-home assessments, referred to as course syntheses, which are not considered difficult. These exams consist of variations on questions that have been previously covered in the problem sets. Additionally, there is a group presentation component at the end of the term. This structure allows students to engage with the material on a deeper level through the problem sets, while also testing their knowledge more straightforwardly via the quizzes. The take-home nature of the midterm and final exams suggests a focus on understanding and applying concepts, rather than memorizing under time pressure. The group presentation likely serves to encourage collaboration and communication skills, as well as a deeper exploration of a particular topic.",2024-04-22T10:37:30.532
50,65,3,"Homework: Assignments: There are 6 assignments. Quizzes: There are a number of quizzes. Projects and Exams: Practicums: There are 2 practicums. Final Oral Exam: There is one final oral exam. Pros: Ease: The course is considered easy. Workload: The workload is not large. Grading: The grading is very generous. Flexibility: If you can't complete the homework on time, extensions are allowed. Bonuses: There are bonus points available. Thanks to these bonuses, my final score on Canvas was over 100%. Cons: Language Requirement: The use of R language is mandatory, which is annoying. Instructor Responsibility: The teacher is not very responsible and doesn’t teach well. Class Cancellations: The teacher has canceled classes multiple times after taking leave. Communication: Sometimes does not respond to messages on Teams or emails. Clarity: Often it is not clear what the teacher is talking about. Once, almost at the end of the class, it was discovered that everything taught in the previous hour was completely wrong. Laughter: The teacher's laughter is infectious and frequent. After each class, his hearty laughter echoes in my head. Overall: Not Recommended for Learning: If you want to learn, this course is not recommended. Recommended for an Easy Experience: If you are looking to have an easy time and focus on job hunting, this course is recommended. It's suggested to take this course during a semester when you're job searching.",2024-04-22T10:37:30.533
52,70,4,Every week there's a project and a quiz. The grading is very good.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.534
52,70,1,"I have no idea why someone would recommend this teacher. This teacher is the most preposterous one I have ever encountered. I must give a negative review!! The lectures are incomprehensible as if speaking about something utterly esoteric. The learning materials are just papers and textbooks. The lecture slides are merely a pile-up of various formulas from the textbooks. Students with a background in machine learning (ML) might find it slightly easier. but for those who have never studied ML. choosing this teacher's class is sheer torture. The homework is very difficult. often cobbled together from various online sources. and the homework instructions are unclear. The final project is graded harshly. with points deducted for having too many people in the team. which can lead to a lack of depth in the project. Although the final exam is open-book. trust me. because the teacher doesn't explain well. you won't find the answers even with Google. The final exam had an average score of 80% for the entire class. Emails are rarely answered. and questions on Piazza are not responded to promptly. Communication is supposed to happen through Teams. but he hardly ever replies there either. The last few sessions of the course were a complete washout with no teaching at all.NLP (Natural Language Processing) is actually a great course. If studied properly. you can learn a lot. If you're interested in this course. you're better off following the class on Stanford's website. Don't waste your time with this teacher.I have no idea what this teacher is talking about. It's been a whole semester of chatGPT. The teacher seems to be daydreaming during the classes. In a classroom of 100 people. only 10 are online. What is taught has nothing to do with the homework. For the first 9 weeks. there were weekly quizzes. and even the quizzes seemed to be created in a daze. With chatGPT. you still have to write for 10+ hours every week. The project feedback is entirely unconstructive. and the TA doesn't understand the content either. The most they say is ""I can't tell you the answer. You need to look over your answer again yourself.""",2024-04-22T10:37:30.535
52,70,5,It seems that the teacher is very tired. perhaps due to their age. They should no longer rely on teaching classes. and students are left to self-study. The course has frequent due dates. essentially having a due date every two days.I strongly do not recommend this course. The teacher is not clear in their lectures and is not proactive in answering questions. Additionally. there's a presentation requirement for the final exam. This teacher also teaches the 5001 course. and I suggest that folks should avoid it. However. it is true that the grades given are very high. almost full marks. I very much advise against taking this course. The content taught is essentially high school level mathematics in my country. and the most discouraging part is having to do a project at the end of the term. I fail to understand the point of learning a bunch of high school math without teaching coding and then doing a project. Anyone who can should waive this course. save the six thousand dollars. and buy many LeetCode memberships instead. This course itself is a trap. and no matter which teacher is teaching. its essence is still high school math.I disagree with the above comment. Scott is one of the few good teachers in Portland.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.536
52,70,4,The homework is quite simple. You can basically complete it by reviewing the lecture slides. However. some of the questions have not been proofread. resulting in a few minor flaws.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.537
46,54,3,The exams are very easy. and the grading is good. Your grade relies entirely on self-study from the textbook.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.538
46,54,2,The person is really nice. but the teaching quality is quite poor. The speaking pace is extremely fast. and there's hardly enough time to take notes before moving on to the next slide. Nearly the full three hours of each class are used up. Homework is assigned weekly. with a medium to high level of difficulty and a reasonable amount of questions. The midterm exam was a nightmare. with many difficult questions. and in the 2.5 hours given. it seemed like almost no one was able to finish. Given another chance. I would definitely not choose Professor Mukund again.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.539
57,82,2,The workload is quite heavy. filled with complex mathematical problems that can be quite time-consuming.Addition: The workload is a bit too much. with both readings and assignments (+1). Although it's simple compared to what's in my country (as many difficult concepts are not covered). the volume of work is not small. Plus. she often has issues clarifying the conditions of her own problems. leading to arguments over deducted points. There's no final exam. instead there are documents to write and code to solve problems. However. her grading is relatively generous. so I endured it.Further addition: The above addition is very objective. If there are no other teachers available. then choose her. The final grade is not bad.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.540
57,82,4,The course includes a midterm exam. but it is not difficult. The main focus is on learning AWS (Amazon Web Services). The workload is moderate. and the material covered is quite practical.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.541
54,75,5,"This course originally had a lot of homework, but the teacher removed many of the unimportant assignments. Grading is lenient. Homework: Lab: There is a lab assignment nearly every week, which takes about 3 hours to complete. Homework (HW): There is homework every two weeks, divided into two parts: Design part: This part is almost the same each time and can be completed in about 2 hours. Development part: This requires at least one full day. Each class requires writing tests. Final HW: The last homework is to make a small game. The language is Java (the final project requires the use of GUI). Exam: The exam focuses on linked lists and time is very tight. Grades: Grading is based on the whole class ranking. If all three (Assignments, Midterm, Labs) are above 70% -> A. One below 70% -> A-. Two below 70% -> B+. All three below 70% -> B.",2024-04-22T10:37:30.542
18,52,5,Maryam comes from a mathematics background. She teaches very conscientiously. using a chalkboard for all her writing. She grades fairly. You can genuinely learn a lot from her classes. Highly recommended.,2024-04-22T10:37:30.543
